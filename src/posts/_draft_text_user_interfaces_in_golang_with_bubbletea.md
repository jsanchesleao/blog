# text user interfaces in golang with bubbletea

#### and why I care about learning how to code one

Recently I have spent a lot of my productive time using a terminal emulator, as I made a comeback to vim and tmux. After a quick search I realised that there are many really well made tools that run in text mode, some of them with nice and beautiful interfaces, such as `tig`, a git interface, or the famous `htop`.

Then I thought it would be a fun endeavor to go after learning how to code a tool like this. The problem is that the last time I wrote a complete terminal based application was about 15 years ago, using Pascal, and I wanted to see what tools for what languages are available today (Pascal was already dead then, so now it might be a nostalgic run, but with little real benefit)

So I set my goals:

- Find a few libraries that could create text interfaces
- Learn a bit about the language this library uses
- Create a simple todo list app
- Integrate this app to my vim/tmux workflow
