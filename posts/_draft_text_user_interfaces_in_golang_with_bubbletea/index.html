    <h1>text user interfaces in golang with bubbletea</h1>
<h4>and why I care about learning how to code one</h4>
<p>Recently I have spent a lot of my productive time using a terminal emulator, as I made a comeback to vim and tmux. After a quick search I realised that there are many really well made tools that run in text mode, some of them with nice and beautiful interfaces, such as <code>tig</code>, a git interface, or the famous <code>htop</code>.</p>
<p>Then I thought it would be a fun endeavor to go after learning how to code a tool like this. The problem is that the last time I wrote a complete terminal based application was about 15 years ago, using Pascal, and I wanted to see what tools for what languages are available today (Pascal was already dead then, so now it might be a nostalgic run, but with little real benefit)</p>
<p>So I set my goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find a few libraries that could create text interfaces</li>
<li>Learn a bit about the language this library uses</li>
<li>Create a simple todo list app</li>
<li>Integrate this app to my vim/tmux workflow</li>
</ul>
